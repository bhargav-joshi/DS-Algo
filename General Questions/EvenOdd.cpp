/* Number is Even or Odd

We can determine whether a number is even or odd. This can be tested using different methods. The test can be done using simple methods such as testing the numberâ€™s divisibility by 2. If the remainder is zero, the number is even. If the remainder is not zero, then the number is odd. The following algorithm describes how a C program can test if a number is even or odd.

Example :

Number is 24
It is an even number because it is exactly divisible by 2

Number is 15
It is odd number because it is not divisible by */


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
cout << "Enter a number: ";
  int check;
  cin >> check;
  //checking whether the number is even or odd
  if (check % 2 == 0)
    {
      cout << check << " is an even number";
    }
  else
    {
      cout << check << " is an odd number";
    }
  return 0;
}
