/* Write a program to find the greatest of two numbers
The greatest of two numbers can be identified with the help of IF-ELSE statement. The user is asked to insert two integers. The numbers inserted are then calculated using a set of program to get the correct output. It will find the highest number among them using IF-ELSE Statement and start checking which one is larger to display the largest number.

Example â€“ If the given numbers are 12 and 9 then greater number is 12 12, 9= 12>9
